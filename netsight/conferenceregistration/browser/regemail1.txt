same time.

If for any reason you were not able to pay at the time
you can retreive this registration and retry the payment
by using the following link:

Just to remind you, we need your payment settled before
you arrive at the event. If for any reason you are unable
to pay online by card or paypal then please contact us

Regards,
Matt and the Plone Conference Organising Team
