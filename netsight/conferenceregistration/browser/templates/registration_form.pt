	<p>To register for Plone Conference 2010, fill in the registration form below.
	  If you are registering a number of people then you will have a chance to add
	  multiple registrations to your cart before checking out to pay.</p>

	<p>All payments will be handled via Paypal. You do not need to have a Paypal
	  account to pay, you can simply enter your credit card details if you want.</p>

	<p>For those of you planning on submitting a talk, we will not be finialising the talk
	  schedule until much closer to the event, so you should purchase a ticket at the early bird
	  rate and if you talk is accepted then we will refund you the difference.</p>

	<p>Conference ticket prices:</p>
	<table class="plain">

	  <tr><th>Ticket</th><th>Price</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>Regular</td><td>&pound;320 (+VAT)</td><td>Available from 1st August</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Speaker</td><td>&pound;150 (+VAT)</td><td>Available for accepted speakers only</td></tr>

	</table>

	<p>Unfortunately, due to recent changes in tax laws here in the UK, we have to charge VAT (17.5%)
	  on all ticket sales regardless of whether you are in the EU or not. You may be able to claim
	  VAT back through your own tax system.</p>
