Introduction
============
This package adds support to register users for things. 

TODO
====
 - The page workflow to add/remove and go back and update is really 
   rough and needs updating
 - on install, add folders and mark interfaces where needed
 - Remove [read:hide] Food option
 - Ask about people bringing families and if they would be interested in a 
   set of coordinated activities for them (# of kids too?)
 - update badge types
 - email.py needs to use server configure with mailhost and not netsights url
 - Can we pull ploneorg user information into the registration form? to prefill?
 - don't need subtotal/tax in carts
 - Items in cart should have attendee name but now its empty
 
 
TODO (at some point - low priority)
-----------------------------------
 - seems like the conference registration email should be sent after payment confirmation?
 - Put conference year configuration in something more sane, or at least just 
   add a control panel.
